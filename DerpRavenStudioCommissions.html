        <p>Still working on this at the moment, sorry. Also trying to build my portfolio. </p>

    <section id = "TermsOfService" class = "drop-down">
        <p>This is the rules and such for my commissions. I know no one likes to read these so I will keep it brief.</p>
        <p>Thank you for looking at me for some art! I am honored as I know I am still growing and learning.</p>
        <p>Payment: I only accept Paypal, Kofi, Venmo, or on the rare occasion, Discord Nitro. I demand half payment up front, after consultation, with the second half due by completion. If you are asking for a full color and shading piece, I need the second half of payment upon approval of the line art. If you can't pay right away, I will bump your commission spot back until you can. If after 2 months I am still awaiting payment, you can consider your spot forfeit.</p>
        <p>Turn Around Time: I plan on having my turn around time somewhere between 1-10 days depending on what is being asked for and the complication of the piece. I will give you an estimate of completion with it. If I fall behind on this, I will give you a discount code for your next piece.</p>
        <p>Included Services: I offer 1 free resketch before a fee will be charged for more. This is due to my time and creative rights.</p>
        <p>Use of art: Once the art is finished, you may do with it what you will. You paid me for your art, it is yours. Just please credit me.</p>
        <p>What is not allowed in a request: I refuse to do any nudity as of yet. I will do vore, and some other things, but nothing overly sexual. </p>
        <p>Reserved Rights: I reserve the right to cancel a commission at any time for any reason. I also reserve the right to deny any piece I do not feel comfortable working on or completing. Please do not be mad at me for these. I do this for the fun of it, and if I am not having fun with it, I don't want to waste my time being miserable.</p>
