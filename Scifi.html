        <h1>Welcome to Sci-fi!</h1>
        <p></p>

        <h1>What races are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>There is a whole slew of alien like races that you can chose from. The races range from humanoid races, to more beastial races. For further information on the races avaliable, please look in the <a href="Resources.html">resources</a> page. </p>

        <h1>What classes are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>There are only four classes or specifications (specs) avaliable for now.</p>
        <h2>TECH(Technology & Hacking)</h2>
        <p>Spec Equipped and trained in use of Holographic Matter Emitter or Drones</p>
        <p>Description: There are two wonderful things that you get with this class. A Drone and Holographic Matter Emitters.</p>
        <p>Role: Frontline Support and Recon</p>
        <p>There are several different types of drone. Drones come in many shapes and sizes and are packed with many kinds of equipment for combat, utility or defense. They can be bipedal, hovering, and quadruped. They can operate with or without their controller and can do many tasks, some TECH’s will even put in simple VI’s (virtual intelligence) into them to further personalize their drones.</p>
        <p>Holographic matter emitters are like little projections that can be mildly interacted with. Although they don't have physical matter, the holographic matter they do have can do simple things like create distractions, or be used to give away enemy positions or used to fake out opponents. They aren't the cheapest things but they have very little damage they can take before the chips are damaged to the point of no repair.</p>

        <h2>CBT(Combat)</h2>
        <p>Spec Equipped and Trained in use of Munitions Conversion Matrix, and Repulsor Tech.</p>
        <p>Description: Combat trained personnel are given Munition Conversion Matrix, and Repulsor tech.</p>
        <p>Role: Frontline combat</p>
        <p>Munitions Conversion Matrix’s or (MCM’s) are top of the line devices that can convert energy of one type into another, which means picking up any kind of energy cell means you’re energy weapons will always be able to be supplied with fresh cells, sadly this technology doesn’t support Ballistic weaponry, so always be sure to have a energy weapon alongside your ballistic ones.</p>
        <p>Newly minted Repulsor tech is a wonder of the technology breakthrough at UGIS, these wrist mounted gadgets can send a blast of potent kinetic and magnetic force in the direction of the projector face of the gadget. This wave of force can drastically alter the flight path of most incoming objects (like debris or grenades!), it even works on yourself, try jumping and using your bracer while having it pointed below you, it’s quite the experience!</p>

        <h2>RCN(Reconnaissance)</h2>
        <p>Spec Equipped with Prototype Stealth suit and a Mag grapple launcher.</p>
        <p>Description: Recon trained personnel are given Prototype Stealth Suit, and a Mag Grapple Launcher.</p>
        <p>Role: Forward Reconnaissance, and mobile Support</p>
        <p>The Prototype Stealth Suits are a technology given to use by the eggheads of Quantum Engagements Inc. This suit provides the wearer nearly complete optical camouflage but it suffers from overheating issues if used too much, also the suit itself is rather weak, meaning most small arms will easily damage it. The tradeoff however is being nearly completely invisible to the naked eye by any living things, (unless they see in thermal vision). The other big bonus is that it has a built-in tactical recording software that allows you to directly send what the wearer is seeing to their ship, via an encrypted frequency.</p>
        <p>The Mag Grapple Launcher is a new invention courtesy of Magnet Revelations™, these new devices allow the user to propel a magnetized line of metal cabling several stories in the blink of an eye, and due to how much force these have, they can easily be used to rappel up walls or flung to different points in a swinging motion to cover ground at incredible speeds. Also it can be handy to save a pal who's falling and in need of a hand. (Just be sure to switch the power output of the arm mounted rail launcher first, don't wanna kill a friend!)</p>

        <h2>HCHM(Heavy Combat & Hazardous Materials)</h2>
        <p>Spec Equipped with D-CHM inc Hazard gear, and Barrier tech.</p>
        <p>Description: Personnel who acquire the training necessary for being equipped with a D-CHM Hazard Suit, and Barrier Tech.</p>
        <p>Role: Heavy Frontline combat and Frontline Defense</p>
        <p>The incredibly expensive venture to secure D-CHM suits, has paid off with every team being able to have a team member trained with one of these special suits. The biggest tradeoff for wearing one of these is the fact they are personally calibrated to the wearer, meaning no one else can wear it. Also the bulk of it reduces the wearer's movement capabilities on land, but it has built in micro ion thrusters for use in zero G, allowing it to be used as an EVA suit for limited periods. Also the suit is rated to withstand highly dangerous waste and toxic matter with no damage to the suit or wearer.This suit has been tested in a live demonstration with Element 116(Ichor), and an exposed breached ship reactor core.</p>
        <p>Barrier tech is a marvel of practical light engineering, for barrier tech creates a hexagonal barrier of energy and light that protects those behind it from weapons fire, but it only lasts a limited time when taking continual damage. This barrier can even protect from high grade military munitions, in testing a barrier received and withstood a Series 1 autocannon from a surplus Switch Jack mech (Mechanica Model SJ-1C), and survived.</p>

        <h2>AMS (Assigned Medical Support)</h2>
        <p>Spec Equipped with a pack of Medi-foam canisters and a ‘Hand of Life’ HL-4U Resuscitation tool</p>
        <p>Description: Personnel who acquire the limited training for AMS are given Medi-foam Canister Pack and a HL-4U Resuscitation tool</p>
        <p>Role: Limited Medical support</p>
        <p>The Medi-foam canister pack is a homebrewed solution to the current medical crisis the galaxy is facing, the lack of trained medical personnel has made UGIS come up with this stop gap solution. Giving one member of each team a Medi-foam Canisters with instructions is fine, but having a specified member of the group trained in their use and supplied with a backpack loaded with them ready to go is a surefire way to improve survivability of teams in dangerous areas. These packs are loaded with 6 canisters which can fill a major wound cavity with medical foam loaded with painkillers, and medications for mending the injury, which allows the receiver the chance to still be functional even when receiving a major wound.</p>
        <p>The ‘Hand of Life’ or HL-4U resuscitation tool is something given over by the Human surplus department, these metal gloves allow the wearer to use a charge of volt energy to bring someone back from the brink, by jump starting their heart and nervous system.</p>

        <h2>DRV (Driver Responsible for Vehicles)</h2>
        <p>Spec Equipped with a Ground Based vehicle and Modular Repair Kit</p>
        <p>Description: Personnel who are granted a ground vehicle and Modular Repair Kit to maintain it and the vessel used to transport it.</p>
        <p>Role: Ground based Vehicle Support and Transportation, Engineering support</p>
        <p>Ground Vehicles come in many shapes and sizes and through an extensive training regime you’ve been taught how to operate most* terrestrial vehicles, whether they be hovercraft, wheeled vehicles, or even Ultra Light Automobia.</p>
        <p>To keep the Ground vehicles Running and even provide mechanical and engineering support for the space ship the DRV is also equipped with the Modular repair kit, which is a backpack assembly that has a multitude of applicable tools and capacities.</p>

        <h2>SFO (Satellite Fabricator Operator)</h2>
        <p>Spec Equipped with the Fabri-tech Wrist Mounted Computer(WMC) paired with a Tactical Display visor both are linked with the expensive Satellite Micro Fabricator, made by Mechanica & UGIS</p>
        <p>Description: Personnel who are trained and capable of operating the WMC and Satellite micro Fabricator.</p>
        <p>Role: Orbital Support, Long term Salvaging and, Orbital offensive capability.</p>
        <p>The Fabri-tech wrist computer paired with a Tactical display visor allows the user to be able to send requests to the orbiting Satellite Fabricator and using them they can use the entire kit together to call in orbital strikes, defenses, turrets, spare parts the list goes on. This unholy combination of abilities is only limited to the creativity and ingenuity of the Person in charge of operating it, though it does require resources, that luckily can be found when scavenging and salvaging derelicts, wrecks and all sorts of debris left over by other people in the Dark zone.</p>


        <h1>What kind of combat will we be looking at?</h1>
        <p>If you have seen any kind of Star Wars movie, you can start to get a good picture of what kind of combat you are looking at. Take a western style shoot out movie and combine it with a scifi movie and you have the combat system. You can use cover, you can use the environment to your advantage, and you can use your allies to help you out. The combat system is very fluid and can be very fast paced. If you are not careful, you can easily get yourself killed.
        </p>

        <h1>Do I need to have previous experience to join the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Previous experience is always nice but never needed. If you have never played in a campaign of Tree's, don't worry, you always have one veteran player that is willing to help you. Tree's wife, Riley, is in each campaign and is more than happy to help new players learn. She will help you learn the combat system, how the magic works and any nuances that are associated with the campaigns.</p>

        <h1>Is there any requirements to get into the campaign?</h1>
        <p>The only requirement for this campaing would be that you need to have a very basic understanding of the setting lore. Beyond this, there is not much else.</p>
