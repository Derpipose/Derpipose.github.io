The Sentinel, is a far cry from a stationary defender, rather, they utilize rapid movement and the reach of their polearms to exploit enemies weaknesses and gaps in their defenses. They use throwing weapons to feign attacks and create openings for themselves to punch hard hitting strikes through the toughest opponents. Sentinels have different combat styles named after the old draconids: Dragon, Wyvern, Drake, and Wurm.
