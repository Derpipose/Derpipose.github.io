        <h1>Art 1120 Showcase</h1>
        <p>Name: Riley Koerner</p>
        <p>Details: This is a showcase of all of the work that I did for my Summer 2023 Art 1120 class. You can see all of the sketches and final works in the gallery below. If you want to see some fun information on a piece, hover over it to view the flavor text. There may be some minor bugs here and there in the website as this was something that I did code myself. Please forgive me if things don't look quite right. </p>
