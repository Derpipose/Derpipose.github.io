        <h1>Welcome to Seekers!</h1>
        <p>The Seekers Setting. This is by far one of the realest, and darkest settings that Tree has to offer.</p>

        <h1>What races are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>Let's see, there's human, human, human and mutant (mute). </p>

        <h1>What classes are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>There are six classes:</p>

        <h2>Ranger</h2>
        <p>Listen up, Ranger. Your job is critical to the survival of a Seeker group, so you had better do it right. You take command in combat and direct your group in tactics, but don’t think that excludes you from the fight. Your weapons are well suited to covering fire, so keep that in mind. After the battle is done, your next job comes into play: medic. You keep your Seekers team alive, and you make sure they get home in one piece. Don’t forget that. Lastly, you are trained in survival skills to make sure your group can cope with whatever monsters and mother nature have in store for you, and your team.</p>
        <p>Specialties: Commander, Survivalist, Medic</p>
        <p>Starting weapon of choice: Assault Rifles, Battle Rifle</p>
        <p>Ability Score Priorities: Charisma, Constitution</p>


        <h2>Trooper</h2>
        <p>Trooper, your role in a Seeker group is focused, but no less important than any other members. You are the frontline of the group; if you’ve done your job correctly, then there will be nothing left to shoot at your team long before they reach you. Your weapons are suited for any occasion, but are not the only tools at your disposal. Your armor and shield will serve you and your party well, so treat them with respect. Don’t shy away from using them in the most innocuous or dire circumstances. You’re the only one we can spare the proper armor for, so you need to protect your Seekers group. Good luck, Trooper.</p>
        <p>Specialties: Guns Blazing, Shield, Hardy</p>
        <p>Starting Weapon of Choice: SMG, Shotgun, Carbine</p>
        <p>Ability Score Priorities: Constitution, Dexterity</p>

        <h2>Crafter</h2>
        <p>Crafter. It is quite the achievement to earn that title. It may not be as flashy as the others, but you still hold an important place in the Seekers group. You’re the mobility to get the other Seekers out of trouble, or into it if the circumstance is right. You use your knack for knowing how things work to create amazing items, but don’t hoard this talent to yourself. If you do, you may as well be alone out there. A word of caution, the others likely won’t be able to keep things working, so that responsibility falls on you. Don’t let me, or the team down.</p>
        <p>Specialties: Repairman, Driver, Creator</p>
        <p>Starting Weapon of Choice: Shotgun, Pneumatic Guns</p>
        <p>Ability Score Priorities: Intelligence, Constitution</p>

        <h2>Scavenger</h2>
        <p>Scavenger, you know your job, but I am going to tell you again to make sure it got through that thick skull of yours. You dismantle everything. Be they old helicopters, raiders, or monsters. Everything else just works from there. You specialize in pistols. They may seem like they will do nothing, but you are the fastest draw out there. You take pride in those. Aside from that, I know you will survive anything the outside throws at you. Try not to blow up a city though, it is difficult to get scrap from that kind of wreckage.</p>
        <p>Specialties: Bruiser, Scrapper, Duelist</p>
        <p>Starting Weapon of Choice: Shotgun, Sidearms/Revolvers, Large Melee weapons </p>
        <p>Ability Score Priorities: Strength, Wisdom</p>

        <h2>Trapper</h2>
        <p>Trapper, you more than any of the others know about the strange and impossible things that roam the world now. You know their tactics, their tools and can use them to great effect now. If the rest of your Seekers team gets on you about the “weird stuff” you do, just remember, alchemy was scientifically developed, so you won’t be lying when you tell them what you do is science. Do whatever it takes to get the job done and keep your group safe. You have been taught how to be sneaky, and you learned to trap. Now use your brain and put your skills to good use outside, in the real world. Be sure to write down everything, your new found information is critical.</p>
        <p>Specialties: Alchemy, Infiltrator, Trapping</p>
        <p>Starting Weapon of Choice: Carbines, Rifle</p>
        <p>Ability Score Priorities: Intelligence, Dexterity </p>

        <h2>Hunter</h2>
        <p>Hunting only partially describes your profession. You are the eyes and ears of your Seekers group, warning them of the dangers ahead. Or, you take care of the dangers ahead. Whichever the situation requires. You know animals, mutated or otherwise, and you’ve developed a knack for getting along with them. Knowing that, you still have much to learn from them, as they have senses that we do not. Use this to your advantage, and remember you don’t have to be alone.</p>
        <p>Specialties: Scouting, Hunting, Pathfinder</p>
        <p>Starting Weapons of Choice: Rifle, Bow/Crossbows</p>
        <p>Ability Score Priorities: Dexterity, Wisdom</p>

        
        <h2>Mutant</h2>
        <p>You were changed by the world. Your path is ultimately your own, but be warned: if your mutations become a danger for the group, you may just be left behind, or worse. Best remember that, Mute.</p>
        <p>Mutation: Can be race or class, as race it is a minor mutation, while as a class, a major mutation</p>
        <p>Specialties: Mutant as a class simply replaces the trees of another class with the mutation tree. It is based around upgrading and honing your mutation. Mutant as a race is much more minor, and usually is a small passive, or purely aesthetic thing.</p>
        <p>Abilities: Varies depending on mutation</p>
        

        <h1>What kind of combat will we be looking at?</h1>
        <p></p>

        <h1>Do I need to have previous experience to join the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Sadly, yes. You need to have been in at least one other campaign for you to qualify for this one. It is brutal and you will find out the hard way. </p>

        <h1>Are there any other requirements to get into the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Only understand that there is a heavy lean on roleplay and you need to be comfortable role playing with other people. If you want a more combat focused campaign, this is likely the most combat focused campaign that Tree will be offering. Know that you are not immortal. You can die and it won't be pretty.</p>
