        <h1>Art 1120 Showcase</h1>
        <p>Name: Riley Koerner</p>
        <p>Details: This is a showcase of all of the work that I did for my Summer 2023 Art 1120 class. You can see all of the sketches and final works in the gallery below. If you want to see some fun information on a piece, hover over it to view the flavor text. There may be some minor bugs here and there in the website as this was something that I did code myself. Please forgive me if things don't look quite right. </p>

            <div class="title">Illusion of space sketch</div>
            <div class="caption">This was the sketch that I had done after going on a walk and taking some pictures of different areas that I thought I may want to use for my illusion of 3D space assignment. I thought about the different things that make up the illusion of 3D space within 2D surfaces and came up with this kind of idea of a raven looking curiously at a box.</div>

            <div class="title">Illusion of space</div>
            <div class="caption">This is the final version of the Illusion of space project. I added in a few characters, manipulating their size to help give the illusion of drawn space.</div>

            <div class="caption">This was a draft of the icons that I thought I could do up. I did several with each prompt, thinking over each carefully before I decided on one of each.</div>

            <div class="caption">These were the final icons that I sketched and very carefully lined out. They could still use a bit of revision, but this was what I decided to go with in the end.</div>

            <div class="caption">This assignment had us taking Wingdings to create a story. The story in question was Jack and Jill. We needed to do this using only the wingdings. These were the sketches I came up with. </div>
