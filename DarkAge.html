        <h1>Welcome to Dark Age!</h1>
        <p>The Dark Age Setting. This is by far one of the darkest settings that Tree has run.</p>

        <h1>What races are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>Most any fantasy race in Tree's setting is up for grabs. There are a few exceptions, of course. Beastmen are very <i>very</i> rare. There was something that happened that altered most of them. Kobolds and Strathund are still pretty feral but you might be able to play them if you ask and figure things out with Tree. Everything else is pretty good to use. </p>

        <h1>What classes are avaliable?</h1>
        <p>Any standard class in Tree's settings are up for grabs but note that any class that uses diplomacy skills, will likely be neigh useless as... Spoiler alert, there will be few to be diplomatic with. Your best bet would be either a combat or magic class.</p>

        <h1>What kind of combat will we be looking at?</h1>
        <p>Creatures have started to run completely rampant. Got a tiger? Nope, it's a dire tiger. Creatures and beasts have become dangerously powerful. </p>

        <h1>Do I need to have previous experience to join the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Previous experience is always nice but never needed. If you have never played in a campaign of Tree's, don't worry, you always have one veteran player that is willing to help you. Tree's wife, Riley, is in each campaign and is more than happy to help new players learn. She will help you learn the combat system, how the magic works and any nuances that are associated with the campaigns.</p>

        <h1>Is there any requirements to get into the campaign?</h1>
        <p>Only understand that there is a heavy lean on roleplay and you need to be comfortable role playing with other people. If you want a more combat focused campaign, this is likely the most combat focused campaign that Tree will be offering but it won't be the main focus. Your main focus here is to rebuild what little you can and create a new area.  </p>
